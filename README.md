# Hi, I'm Natalia 👋 

### Frontend Developer | User-Focused Engineer

I’m a Frontend Developer who made the move into engineering after 5 years in Brand Management. Because of my background, I’m obsessed with how users actually experience a product. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code that makes a real difference to the people using it.

## 📝 A Note on my GitHub Activity
Most of my daily work happens in **private company repositories** on GitLab (working on insurance products). Even if my public contribution graph looks a bit quiet, I’m coding every day, focusing on building clean, reliable components and solving product problems.
